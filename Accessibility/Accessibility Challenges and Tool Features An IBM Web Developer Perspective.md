## Use

## Abstract
- Using evidence from a survey of 49 IBM Web developers we explore two concerns: barriers to the developers’ designing accessible Web-based products, and what value they felt specific features in an "accessibility" tool might have. They found designing for accessibility difficult, but more surprisingly, they found using the test tools and finding technology workarounds equally hard. 
- ...the more experienced the developer, the more they valued the other features, particularly being able to experience a site as someone with a particular disability would, and being able to pinpoint a problem on the rendered view of a page. The survey results suggest existing tools are often unclear, cumbersome, and incomplete with respect to the standards that must be met.


## Notes and Thoughts
### Related Work
-  In a survey of 334 professional and hobbyist Web developers, Rosson et al. observed that while developers were quite conscious of overall quality and usability issues, only 5% of respondents performed accessibility testing. They hypothesize that this may be partly due to a lack of awareness and concern, and partly due to the “relatively tedious and time consuming tool support for such checks (too verbose, reporting many false positives; lack of automation)”
- It has been estimated that more than half of the provisions in most accessibility standards require human judgment to evaluate \[3].


### Summary
- ⭐ Even when developers are motivated to provide accessible applications, they are hampered by incomplete skills, new standards, incomplete browser implementations, and inconsistencies in assistive technologies. Tools that should help developers are often unclear, cumbersome, and incomplete when compared to the standards to be tested.
