# INDS On Accessibility

## Plan:
- Work on an hour and a half a day
- Find big list of books and articles to read 
- Read
- Narrow down topic
- Maybe come up with a question

Reading papers:
- Come in with a question
- Abstract, sometimes don't need to go beyond this
- For reading research papers, skip results, go to discussion. 

Maybe look at certain guidelines in particular
- Is is the framework's responsibility 
	- Maybe look at different frameworks
		- JS and UI/UX (Bootstrap)
			- React relies on basic HTMM stuff for accessibility
	- Dynamic webpage and accessibility
- Semantic web
	- Might be current work in this

## Discussion
- Is there a software solution or something for people willing to provide their labor to make things more accessible 
	- You can kind of go to literature for other design cases, not so much for this
	- How do you get an idea of these experiences without making this too burdensome
- Would it be possible to make it impossible to create an exlcusionary product 
	- Tools we use to make them could make it harder, or the platform would 
	- Platform could adapt to the 
	- Where is the inclusive design done? 
	- How is it possible that people say they prioritize this but it's not done on the paltofmrs end
	- I wonder if the tools to create the "filter" or make things more accessible could be done for the disabled users 
		- Look into this. Disabled designers
		- CHI paper about that. Approaches to accessibility. Who should be making it accessibility   
	- Keep a list of questions to ask people if I want to talk to disabled people 
		- Look for first-hand account

### Writing Outline and Plan
Talk about the levels of accessibility that currently exist. Maybe because there are no clear responsibilities, it is unclear where this work should be done.

- User
	- Does the user need to download their own tools and make sure it is covered for themselves?
	- Open-source and inclusivity 
		- 
- OS
	- 
- Software
	- 
- Interface over software, software to use software

Levels of responsibility
No clear responsibilities
