#### Prompt


### Outline

Make this in the format of a paper, sort of literature review

Talk about the levels of accessibility solutions that currently exist. Maybe because there are no clear responsibilities, it is unclear where this work should be done.

- User
	- Does the user need to download their own tools and make sure it is covered for themselves?
	- Open-source, 'DIY', appropriation, and inclusivity 
		- Often times disabled people appropriate off the shelf products for their own use or DIY their own solutions.
			- [[Would you be Mine]], [[Designing with People with Disabilities - Adapting Best Practices of DIY and Organizational Approaches]]
		- This is very similar to the open source model
			-  [[Open source and accessibility - advantages and limitations]], [[Supporting the Collaborative Appropriation of an Open Software Ecosystem]]
- OS
	- What responsibility does the OS have?
		- Linux does this well, maybe connect to open-source
- Accessibility software, screen readers
	- Rely on good webpages
- Software/browsers
	- What is the responsibility of the software?
	- Design
		- It's hard to bring disabled people in to get feedback (Participatory design)
			- [[Disability Studies as a Source of Critical inquiry for the field of assistive technology]]
	- Coding
		- Challenges for coders here - it's unclear how to implement the solutions that are advocated for on something like W3
			- [[Accessibility Challenges and Tool Features An IBM Web Developer Perspective]]
		- These guidelines don't always lead to a good experience either and are mostly for people with visual disabilities - you can't tailor your software perfectly for everyone and universal design sometimes leads to poor adoption rates
		- Tools that test for adherence to these guidelines don't always work either
			- [[]]
	- Interface over software, software to use software
		- Depends on the other software being designed well
			- [[Disability Studies as a Source of Critical inquiry for the field of assistive technology]]
