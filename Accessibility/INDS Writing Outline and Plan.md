## Thinking

- UI frameworks

**‚≠ê What opportunities for power or change does each level have, what happens if we put these in the hands of the users?**

**Directions:**
- Open source and accessibility
- Who's responsibility is it. And at which level?
- Where is the power? And are there opportunities for redistribution?

**Problems:**
- Hard to implement accessibility for developers, hard to test it
- Hard to know what to do.
	- Can create solutions that are supposed to work for everyone but this is associated with 

- Maybe we can't transfer everything, maybe give it to a mediator, maybe they could do something to change it for the user 

What if there was a govt branch to implement solutions for people?
Could be a total paradigm shift
- Meals on wheels, govt agency going in to install a ramp

Add a discussion session

3 opportunities for change:
- Dev:
	- Setting, moddable
	- Open souce kinda aligns with this but they're not getting paid, not standardized 
- USeR: Get trasining they need to mod
- Third party to bridge the gap, even just to develop a chrome extension or something 


As things currently are, users cannot  


## Outline

Make this in the format of a paper, sort of literature review

Talk about the levels of accessibility solutions that currently exist. Maybe because there are no clear responsibilities, it is unclear where this work should be done. Where is the power currently and where can it be?

All these levels are trying to make things accessible, here are the main levels, here's what's happening in each one, examples, features, limitations, pros/cons maybe make a value judgement

### Abstract

### Introduction

All these levels are trying to make things accessible, here are the main levels, here's what's happening in each one, examples, features, limitations, pros/cons maybe make a value judgment

System as it exists

| OS  | USER | 3rd PARTY | DEV | BROWSER |
| --- | ---- | --------- | --- | ------- |
|     |      |           |     |         |
|     |      |           |     |         |

| OS  |     |     |     |

### Levels as they exist

#### Developer / Designer

##### Accessibility implementations as they exist

##### Opportunities for change

- It's hard to bring disabled people in to get feedback (Participatory design)
	- [[Disability Studies as a Source of Critical inquiry for the field of assistive technology]]
- Can keep accessibility in mind from the very beginning
- Often leads to more creative solutions and better products for everyone, but sometimes Universal Design can lead to poor adoption rates
	- [[]] This is mentioned in [[Would you be Mine]]


#### Operating System

- What responsibility does the OS have?
	- Linux does this well, maybe connect to open-source

- Text only are generally better
- 2007 article says linux was marignally better https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-73279-2_75

#### Software/Browser

- Does the browser have built-in accessibility tools?
- What is the responsibility of the software / browser and thus the person who makes it?
- Challenges for coders here
	- In theory they should just follow standards set up in WCAG, W3 
	- It's unclear how to implement the solutions that they advocate for, and especially difficult for new developers. 
		-  [[Accessibility Challenges and Tool Features An IBM Web Developer Perspective]]
	-  These guidelines don't always lead to a good experience either and are mostly for people with visual disabilities 
	-  You can't tailor your software perfectly for everyone and universal design sometimes leads to poor adoption rates
		-  [[]]
	-  Tools that test for adherence to these guidelines don't always work either
		- [[]]

##### Interface on top of everything else

- Interface over software, software to use software
	- Depends on the other software being designed well
		- [[Disability Studies as a Source of Critical inquiry for the field of assistive technology]]

#### User

##### Power as a user

- Relies on how accessibility is implemented for them. This can be problematic:
	- If designers do not have contact with disabled customers they do not know

##### DIY, Appropriation

- Open-source, 'DIY', appropriation, and inclusivity 
		- Often times disabled people appropriate off the shelf products for their own use or DIY their own solutions.
			- [[Would you be Mine]], [[Designing with People with Disabilities - Adapting Best Practices of DIY and Organizational Approaches]]
		- World of Warcraft example in Mismatch too
			- []

##### Open-Source

- This is very similar to the open source model
	-  [[Open source and accessibility - advantages and limitations]], [[Supporting the Collaborative Appropriation of an Open Software Ecosystem]]
-  Can't expect everyone to be able to code their own solution, so maybe adaptability is the way to go. How do we create adaptable products?

### Conclusion

Make more products that are able to be adapted, make the responsibilities of each level more clear. It's confusing. Very hard for new developers to pick up, more of a design issue I guess
