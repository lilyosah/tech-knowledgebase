## Outline

Make this in the format of a paper, sort of literature review

Talk about the levels of accessibility solutions that currently exist. Maybe because there are no clear responsibilities, it is unclear where this work should be done.

All these levels are trying to make things accessible, here are the main levels, here's what's happening in each one, examples, features, limitations, pros/consm maybe make a value judgement

### Abstract

### Introduction

All these levels are trying to make things accessible, here are the main levels, here's what's happening in each one, examples, features, limitations, pros/consm maybe make a value judgement


### Levels as they exist

#### Designer

- It's hard to bring disabled people in to get feedback (Participatory design)
	- [[Disability Studies as a Source of Critical inquiry for the field of assistive technology]]
- Can keep accessibility in mind from the very beginning
- Often leads to more creative solutions and better products for everyone, but sometimes Universal Design can lead to poor adoption rates
	- [[]] This is mentioned in [[Would you be Mine]]

#### Coder

##### Operating System

- What responsibility does the OS have?
	- Linux does this well, maybe connect to open-source

##### Software/Browser

- What is the responsibility of the software / browser and thus the person who makes it?
- Challenges for coders here
	- In theory they should just follow standards set up in WCAG, W3 
	- It's unclear how to implement the solutions that they advocate for, and especially difficult for new developers. 
		-  [[Accessibility Challenges and Tool Features An IBM Web Developer Perspective]]
	-  These guidelines don't always lead to a good experience either and are mostly for people with visual disabilities 
	-  You can't tailor your software perfectly for everyone and universal design sometimes leads to poor adoption rates
		-  [[]]
	-  Tools that test for adherence to these guidelines don't always work either
		- [[]]

##### Interface on top of everything else

- Interface over software, software to use software
	- Depends on the other software being designed well
		- [[Disability Studies as a Source of Critical inquiry for the field of assistive technology]]

#### User

##### DIY, Appropriation

- Open-source, 'DIY', appropriation, and inclusivity 
		- Often times disabled people appropriate off the shelf products for their own use or DIY their own solutions.
			- [[Would you be Mine]], [[Designing with People with Disabilities - Adapting Best Practices of DIY and Organizational Approaches]]
		- World of Warcraft example in Mismatch too
			- []

##### Open-Source

- This is very similar to the open source model
	-  [[Open source and accessibility - advantages and limitations]], [[Supporting the Collaborative Appropriation of an Open Software Ecosystem]]
-  Can't expect everyone to be able to code their own solution, so maybe adaptability is the way to go. How do we create adaptable products?

### Conclusion

Make more products that are able to be adapted, make the responsibilities of each level more clear. It's confusing. Very hard for new developers to pick up, more of a design issue I guess
