## Abstract
In this paper we discuss the open source process as it relates to accessibility software. Open source is a development model that has shown considerable benefits in a number of application areas. However the nature of accessibility tools and the intended users of such software products raise issues that must be addressed by the developer before users encounter the tools in real world contexts. In this paper we discuss the nature of the open source process, how it functions, and the motivations with regards to participation that developers self-report. We then explain the impact of these elements of the open source process as they relate to adaptive accessibility software. We use some specific examples of issues raised from the adoption of open source via a discussion of the ACCESS Framework, an accessibility engine designed to provide cross-platform accessibility support through plug-ins.

## Notes and Thoughts
- Paper is about open-source and developing an accessibility tool
- Open source: where the source code is distributed alongside the software
- Some motivations for contributing:
	- Perfecting expertise (\[6,11]; Lakhani & Wolf,  \[12]; \[13])  
	- Enhancing reputation (\[14]; Lakhani and Wolf, \[12];  
	\[6,13])  
	- Fun and enjoyment (\[13]; Lakhani & Wolf, \[12]; \[15])  
	- Expectation of reciprocity \[6]  
	- Job Market Signalling \[6,16]  
	- Altruism \[17]  
	- Belief in a principle of development \[6,18]  
	- To fulfil a personal need \[6,19
- p5 "Coupled to this is the fact that open source software often suffers from usability issues \[33,34]"
- Has a section on accessibility software
- p5 "In others, a more subtle interaction of minor ailments may make it difficult to identify a single causative factor and subsequently complicate the search for an appropriate solution."
- There are a series of sort of fire and forget OS accessibility tools, there also exist some that algorithmically detect issues and attempt to correct them
