## Chapter 1: Welcome

- 1 "Designing for inclusion starts with recognizing exclusion."
- Mismatches are barriers to interacting with the world. A byproduct of design
- 3 "Like many people, I initially took inclusion at face value as a good thing. Yet I also found that people rarely made it a consistent priority."
- 4 "Treating inclusion as a benevolent mission increases the separation between people."
- 9 "There is no single answer that suits everyone. Accessible solutions are always, inevitably, accessible to some but not all people", this should not stop you from trying to design accessible products.
- Inclusion requires humility.

Recognize exclusion: Solving problems using our own biases leads to exclusion
Learn from human diversity
Solve for one, extend to many: Focus on what's universally important to all humans

- Excluded leaders can recognize exclusion, finding solutions

## Chapter 2: Shut In, Shut Out

- "A solution becomes a barrier when it's designed only for people with certain abilitie. The brainpower and ingenuity of anyone who doesn’t match that design are simply   untapped. When we create new ways for people to contribute their talents, their contributions influence everyone."
- Less expensive to build inclusive designs from the get-go

Cycle framework to show how mismatched designs mare made and can be remedied:

- Why we make: The motivations that are innate to the problem solver
- Who makes the solution: The problem solver
- How we make: Methods and resources
- Who uses it: Assumptions the problem solver will make about the people who will interact with or benefit from the solution
- What we make

Discussion:
How do you realistically do this at each stage?
Maybe strive against exclusivity instead of strive for inclusivity 

## Chapter 3: Why it's Time to Kick the Habit

Exclusion leads to invisibility of certain groups. 
Being excluded by an object can be more painful than rejection by a person and can even approximate physical pain.
"Exclusion habits stem from a belief that we can’t change aspects of society that were originally set into motion by someone other than ourselves"

## Chapter 4: Inclusive Designers

- Porter uses a wheelchair and must have some mobility issues and is a gamer who uses hardware and software hacks to get around obstacles to playing games, which he usually makes auditorily?
- WOW is inclusive bc although some people can't react fast enough to do a lot of combat, they engage with the economic part of the gaem
- Figuring out **how** to game becomes a part of gaming for him. Not really like a great thing but considers it a metagame
- Today games are able to be made by disabled people as well as huge companies with the resources
- "It’s important to define the specific design skills that contribute to inclusion, so that more people can become practitioners."

**Skills of successful inclusive designers:** 
- Identify biases and mismatched interactions between people and world
- Create a diversity of ways to participate in an experience
- Design for interdependence and bring complementary skills together 


- Making human ability the first consideration means that we start from a universal common ground. Ability is something that is present across all cultures
- Ability biases are very sneaky


==Disability:== a complex phenomenon, reflecting the **interaction** between features of a person’s body and features of the society in which they live.
- Not about a personal health condition
- These points of interaction are where mismatches can happen

==Inclusive design:== A methodology that enables and draws on the full range of human diversity
- A method
- Focuses on how a designer arrived at a solution
- One-size-fits-one #❓ 

==Universal design:== the design of an environment so that it might be accessed and used in the widest possible range of situations without the need for adaption
- Emphasizes the end solution and its attributes
- One-size-fits-all

==Accessibility:== The qualities that make an experience open to all
- An attribute
- Focused on making things accessible

### Making accessibility accessible
- You don't need to know how to do everything, just recognize issues and know when to bring in someone who does and design solutions that work well with assistive technology
