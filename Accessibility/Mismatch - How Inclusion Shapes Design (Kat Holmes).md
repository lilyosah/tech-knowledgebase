## Chapter 1: Welcome

- 1 "Designing for inclusion starts with recognizing exclusion."
- Mismatches are barriers to interacting with the world. A byproduct of design
- 3 "Like many people, I initially took inclusion at face value as a good thing. Yet I also found that people rarely made it a consistent priority."
- 4 "Treating inclusion as a benevolent mission increases the separation between people."
- 9 "There is no single answer that suits everyone. Accessible solutions are always, inevitably, accessible to some but not all people", this should not stop you from trying to design accessible products.
- Inclusion requires humility.

Recognize exclusion: Solving problems using our own biases leads to exclusion
Learn from human diversity
Solve for one, extend to many: Focus on what's universally important to all humans

- Excluded leaders can recognize exclusion, finding solutions

## Chapter 2: Shut In, Shut Out

- "A solution becomes a barrier when it's designed only for people with certain abilitie. The brainpower and ingenuity of anyone who doesn’t match that design are simply   untapped. When we create new ways for people to contribute their talents, their contributions influence everyone."
- Less expensive to build inclusive designs from the get-go

Cycle framework to show how mismatched designs mare made and can be remedied:

- Why we make: The motivations that are innate to the problem solver
- Who makes the solution: The problem solver
- How we make: Methods and resources
- Who uses it: Assumptions the problem solver will make about the people who will interact with or benefit from the solution
- What we make

## Chapter 3: Why it's Time to Kick the Habit

Exclusion leads to invisibility of certain groups. 
Being excluded by an object can be more painful than rejection by a person and can even approximate physical pain.
"Exclusion habits stem from a belief that we can’t change aspects of society that were originally set into motion by someone other than ourselves"
