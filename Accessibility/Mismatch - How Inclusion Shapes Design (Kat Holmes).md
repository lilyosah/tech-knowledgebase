## Chapter 1: Welcome

- 1 "Designing for inclusion starts with recognizing exclusion."
- Mismatches are barriers to interacting with the world. A byproduct of design
- 3 "Like many people, I initially took inclusion at face value as a good thing. Yet I also found that people rarely made it a consistent priority."
- 4 "Treating inclusion as a benevolent mission increases the separation between people."
- 9 "There is no single answer that suits everyone. Accessible solutions are always, inevitably, accessible to some but not all people", this should not stop you from trying to design accessible products.
- Inclusion requires humility.
