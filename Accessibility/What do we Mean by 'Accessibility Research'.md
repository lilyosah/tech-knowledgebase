## Who does accessibility research focus on

- Disproportionately focuses on blind or low vision people (BLV)
- Median sample size of  3 for disabled and older adult groups
- Past study on Autism found that there is a focus on corrective, othering approaches. Authors agree 
- Started with ~500 papers, programatically evaluated
- Mostly BLV, motor physical, DHH, Cognitive...
- Autism mostly focused on changing behaviors, BL and motor access focused on increasing digital access
What are the stated goals

## What research methods are used

==Participatory design:== Provides a method and vision for involving users of tech directly in its design (p8)

- Mainly user studies (94%)
	- Mainly interviews, usability testing (contextual inquiry), then controller experiments
	- 90% contained srudies with people with disabilities or older adults
	- Several papers only had 1-2 paritipants, one had 100+, median was 13  (p7)
	- 10% said they were doing participatory design, and some engaged in "rich design processes" such as crafting, bodystorming, play-acting, ideating on prompts. Make it easier to involve some disabled groups (p8)


## How has accessibility research evolved over time

- Accessibility research has really grown over time. p9
- Cognitive and austistic studies have only began recently 
- Studies in the future can consider how different identities intersect (Ex: disabled, race, gender)
- Some groups don't want to be told to change their behavior (Autism, IDD) but it's a comparatively popular focus 
- Some research methods can be exclusionary (Ex: PD to people with aphasia ) 
- Sometimes they only do one session
- Small sample sizes but may not be a limitation because may reduce burden on participants
- Role of non-disabled people: Can be useful but must be approached with caution as they can reinforce normative ablest beliefs 
- Highly varied langauge make analysis more difficulty
