# My public tech knowledge-base

Lily Davisson

These are my notes from classes and my own learning from the past ~year. Feel free to use them as you'd like. They are actively being added to as I learn, so many notes are unfinished.

I'd **highly** recommend navigating these files with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which is how I wrote them and use them myself. That's the only way you can follow links to other notes (super important for the way they are structured!), see any graphs I have made with [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/), or see notes embedded in another note, which I do a lot. See [[Data Structures]] for an example of lots of embedded notes.

## Getting Started 
### Open with Obsidian
1. Clone repo wherever you'd like
2. Download Obsidian
3. If you would like to start "fresh" with Obsidian, delete the .obsidian file before opening the folder. This clears my settings (extensions, themes, hotkeys, etc.)
4. On Obsidian startup, open the cloned repo file as a vault.
	1. Select turn safe mode off (this allows you to use the community-built extensions that I've downloaded and use, which I recommend. If you don't want to use them then you can choose to keep safe mode off)

### Some helpful things
- Check out my list of helpful hotkeys at [[My Hotkeys]] (Using-Obsidian/My Hotkeys.md) If you delete the .obsidian folder your hotkeys may be different from mine. Especially if you're using a Mac. To see and edit hotkeys, open settings (gear at bottom left) and go to hotkeys
	- Open command switcher with `ctrl + shift + p`
	- Open file switcher with `ctrl + o`
	- Open settings with `ctrl + shift + s`
	- Switch between note edit and preview mode with `ctrl + shift + e`
	- Open graph view with `ctrl + g`
- If you ever need help, the help button at the bottom left opens an extremely useful vault about how to use Obsidian
- If you want to switch themes or use light mode, this can be accessed through settings -> appearance. The one I'm using now is a version of [Cybertron](https://github.com/nickmilo/Cybertron) that I've modified

### Why I love Obsidian
Obsidian is really awesome, I've loved using it for notes and learning thus far. I found it a little overwhelming at the beginning, so here are some of it's coolest feature and how to use them.

- Notes are written in markdown, which means they are usable outside of the software and are unlikely to become obsolete for the foreseeable future as markdown has been used for many years
	- File sizes are relatively small
- Adds some additional features to plain markdown, like links between files and the ability to embed sections of notes in other places
	- Renders any graphs you include using Mermaid -- really helpful for computer science
	- Syntax highlighting for code blocks -- also really useful in my case
- Files are stored locally
	- Don't have to worry about service outages
	- Removes privacy concerns
	- If you want to back up your files like I am, [there is a great extension](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) to automatically push your vault to a GitHub repo
	- You can also pay to backup your notes through Obsidian or even host them publicly
- It's open-source and free!
	- Lots of community-built extensions. The ones that I use will (I believe) be downloaded on startup as I've included my .obsidian file. If you want to start fresh, delete this file before opening this folder (tech-knowledgebase)) in Obsidian
	- To install more, open settings with `ctrl + shift + s` and go to community plugins
- Templates allow you to quickly insert snippets of frequently used text
- The linking system is very powerful, useful, and fun
	- Links between notes are indicated by surrounding the note title you're linking to with brackets. In Obsidian, clicking on this link will take you to that note. On that note, there is a backlink panel that will include a link back to the note you linked from
	- There is also a really cool graph view mode where you can visualize the connections between your notes. 
- Tag system
- Split your screen between many different notes vertically or horizontally or use [Andy's Mode](https://github.com/deathau/sliding-panes-obsidian) to scroll through notes like flashcards or side-by-side papers
