# My public tech database
Lily Davisson

These are my notes from classes and my own learning from the past ~year. Feel free to use them as you'd like. They are actively being added to as I learn, so many notes are unfinished. 

I'd *highly* recommend navigating these files with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which is how I wrote them and use them myself.

## Steps to open with Obsidian:
1. Clone repo wherever you'd like
2. Download Obsidian
3. On Obsidian startup, open the cloned repo file as a vault.
