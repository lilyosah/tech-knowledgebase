# My public tech database

These are my notes from classes and my own learning from the past ~year. Feel free to use them as you'd like. They are actively being added to as I learn, so many notes are unfinished.

I'd **highly** recommend navigating these files with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which is how I wrote them and use them myself. That's the only way you can follow links to other notes (super important for the way they are structured!), see any graphs I have made with [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/), or see notes embedded in another note, which I do a lot. See [[Data Structures]] for an example of lots of embedded notes.

## Steps to open with Obsidian:

1. Clone repo wherever you'd like
2. Download Obsidian
3. On Obsidian startup, open the cloned repo file as a vault.

## Getting Started 

Obsidian is really awesome, I've loved using it for notes and learning thus far. I found it a little overwhelming so far, so here are some of it's coolest feature and how to use them.

### Why I love Obsidian
- Every notes are written in markdown, which means they are usable outside of the software and are unlikely to become obsolete for the foreseeable future as markdown has been used for many years
	- This also means that the file size is relatively low
	- Obsidian adds some features to base markdown, like links bet
