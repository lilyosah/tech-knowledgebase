### Wald Test
#üîç *don't follow this*
If you have an estimation of a parameter $\theta$, then assuming $\hat{\theta}$ is asymptotically normal than the null hypothesis $H_0 = \hat{\theta} = \theta_0$ can be rejected if $|W| > Z_{a/2}$ where $W = {\hat{\theta}-\theta_0}/{\hat{se}}$ where se is the standard error 

- Compute $W$
	- $W$ is like an area under part of a s-dev curve... the probability of the thing??? happening??????

If you want to test a particular parameter to see if it is different from another, hypothesis 0 is that they are equal, H1 is that they are not

$x = {12, 3, 4}$
$x ~ N(mew, sigma)$

**Ex: ‚úè**  
You have a lot of numbers, just guess that one is the mean, then Wald's test is determining if this is true

Null hypothesis: prob of looking into two words is equal to them being selected independently
$H_0 = \hat{\theta} = \theta_0$ 
$P(w_1 w_2) = P(w_1)P(w_2)$
$\theta_0 = P(w_1)P(w_2)$
$P(w_1 w_2) = {c(w_1 w_2)}/{N}$
