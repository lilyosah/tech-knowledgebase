## Problem
I think this is example code to go through and add all words present in this [[Trie]] to a collection

```Java
class TrieNode {
	// tells you whether or not this sequence is a word that exists
	boolean isWord;
	
	//TrieNode[] children = new TrieNode[26];
	HashMap<Character, TrieNode> children = new HashMap<Character, TrieNode>();
	// This is more flexibile, have words that exist, not all alphabet by defualt
}

class Trie {
	// This serves as our dictionary
	TrieNode root = new TrieNode();
	
	// as you travel through you keep trck of which characters you've passed
	public Collection<String> anagram(String target) {
		HashSet<String> list = new HashSet<String>();
		
		helper(root, "", target, list);
		
		return list;
		
	}
	
	private static helper(TrieNode node, String prefix, String remaining, Collection<String> dump) {
		// length must be the same
		// prefix is the letters that lead up to the point where you are at, this kind of goes along with the node, helps with returning the whole word. You couldn't really concatenate as you return because you'd be returning potentially a lot of things and that would be hard to deal with
		if (remaing.length() == 0) {
			if (node.isWord) {
				dump.add(prefix);
			}
			return;
		}
		
		for (int i = 0; i < remaining.size(); i++) {
			char c = remaining.charAt(i);
			TrieNode child = children.get(c);
			// if the child at this character is there
			// it's null if there are no children after this letter
			if (child != null) {
				helper(child, prefix + c, remaining.substring(0,i) + remaining.substring(i+1), dump);
			}		
		}
	}
}

```


## Runtime
#❓ *I don't totally understand the runtime and don't know if the runtime is bad or not*
- $w$ is in terms of the length of the word, not the number of words
- From the root you make $w$ different recursive calls, then in each of those recursive calls you make $w-1$ recursive calls, in each of those you make $w-2$... These are multiplied so = $O(w!)$

$O(w!)$ (There are also just this many combinations of letters)

- This is kind of a bad runtime but the space trade off in tries is good, you only have the words that are actually there
- If you did this in a list of strings, space is $\varOmega(w!)$ which is worse
	- In tries you eliminate unnecessary checks
