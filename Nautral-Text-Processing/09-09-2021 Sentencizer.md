## HW 2
We're making a sentencizer algorithm? Will be compared against another alg and our classmates 
part 3: Create a dataset like one that would be  used in supervised learning, then testing our alg against them

Supervised learning datasets:
- Two pairs, the input sentence and the answer. The sentence boundaries are marked by \#s, most of the time this will work 
- Pick a somewhat obscure book, find a random paragraph, put in one file, put the second (answer) paragraph in another file with a name that includes something about marks. In the second file, replace the end of sentences with the \#. Don't need to do it at the end of the file bc we're kinda marking the start of sentences
