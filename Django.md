## Virtual Environments
Should develop in a Python virtual env to ease differences between platforms. 
[Helpful set-up guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/development_environment)

📝 Had to install virtualenvwrapper-win through pip after opening command prompt as admin

Useful commands: 
- `mkvirtualenv [name]` creates and switches to env
- `deactivate` exits env 
- `workon` lists envs
- `workon [name]` switches to that env 

## Using
To start the webserver: Be in the right env and directory of project, `py manage.py runserver`
