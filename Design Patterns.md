## Singleton
- Can only be one of a class. Like a driver

## Facade
- Hiding the details behind a nice interface. Isn't this the same as abstraction?
- Con: Can over-simplify so not useable or only make it work for one use-case


## Bridge
- Separating the abstraction and the implementation. So you can use several solutions for one problem
- Con: Can overdo it

## Strategy
- Separating different pieces of a problem into different libraries
- Must be good default strategies

## Observer (Pub-sub)
- Allows for loose coupling between publisher (creates events) and subscriber (listens for events)
- Con: Can go overboard, get into event loops
