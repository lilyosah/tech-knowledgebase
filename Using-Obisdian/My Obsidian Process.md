# Steps!
1. Word dump into a note, everything that might be relevant and my own ideas. Tag this note with ðŸ“¥.
2. Eventually, go back through the ðŸ“¥ tag and refactor this note.
	- Add headers, formatting, etc.
	- Link to any relevant concepts
	- Make anything that is its own concept its own note that you can link to
		- Make sure to go through backlinks for the file I'm working on and link anything relevant to this new note. If this is too overwhelming it can be done at a different time, just leave the ðŸ“Œ tag and go back and refactor it eventually.
