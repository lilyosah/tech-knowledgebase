## Jest
Jest is used for React/[[Javascript]] unit testing. Another tool will be needed for integration tests. 
It uses Node, so not a real browser.

Run `npm test` to start in watch mode. By default, only tests files that have changed since last commit. Can press `a` to force it to test all files

```JS
import sum from './sum';

it('sums numbers', () => {  
	expect(sum(1, 2)).toEqual(3);  
	expect(sum(2, 2)).toEqual(4);
});
```


Coverage report: `npm test -- --coverage` *This runs slower than normal tests* 


You can also use [`jest.fn()` and `expect(fn).toBeCalled()`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect.html#tohavebeencalled) to create ‚Äúspies‚Äù or mock functions.

react-testing-library is more suited for integration tests and works more directly with dom nodes.
