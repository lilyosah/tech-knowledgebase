Allow you to turn a feature off or on based on the value of the flag. If used in a [[SaaS (Software as a Service)]], can store in DB table because flag should be able to change value on the fly... Can query the table for the value of the flag?? #‚ùì 

## Uses
- Gradual deployment
- Preflight checking: gradual rollout of feature to increasing numbers of customers
- [[AB Testing]]
