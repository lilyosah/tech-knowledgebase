: part of AI that studies algorithms that can learn from experience

## Types

### Unsupervised Learning

### Supervised Learning
Have a


Representation:
- Objects in a vector $R$
- Can be coordinates in a space

Function $m$ takes an object and turns it into a vector of data
- Depends on how your represent it. May use the dimensions, etc. 
- $d$ is the length of the array

**Ex: ✏**  Putting different types of irises into a data set
$m(\text{flower}) -> R^d$
$R$ is a $d$ dimensional vector (like arrays, 2d arrays, 3d)
They used dimensions of particular parts of the flowers 
Ex: \[2.1, 3.4, 2.3]



Have a set of pairs, $X = {(x1, y1)...}$
Assumption that xi within R^d
There is another vector V associated with R

#### Applications
Both use [[Probability]]

##### Classification
yi within C where C = {c1, c2, ... cl}
##### Regression
yi within R
Where does this thing best fit
