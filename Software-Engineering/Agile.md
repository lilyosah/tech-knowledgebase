Focuses mainly on improving existing code.
Practices center around successive refinement a working but incomplete software prototype until the customer is happy with the result. The customer offers feedback on each iteration, and each iteration is short.
Uses ==Behavior-Driven Design==

## Manifesto
Do the important things more:
- Individual customer interactions
- Working software instead of documentation
- Customer collaboration
- Responding to change

Other features:
- [[Testing#Testing practices|Test driven development]]
- New versions every week or so, continuously improve a working prototype
- User stories instead of documentation

![[Behavior Driven Design]]

## XP Variant 
Extreme programming
- Write [[Testing|tests]] before coding
This practice often employs 1-2 week iterations, behavior- and test-driven development and pair programming

## Testing
- Part of each iteration
- Each dev tests their own code
- Testing tools & processes are highly automated
- QA improves tools
