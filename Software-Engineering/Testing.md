==Verification:== making sure the thing works correctly
==Validation:== making sure you built the right thing 
==Coverage:== the % of code paths that are tested. There are different definitions of coverage and it's impossible by most standards to meet 100% of test coverage
- Does not imply that all code has really been tested, ex: short circuiting and expressions, may never evaluate the second half

## Types of tests
==Unit testing:== makes sure a single method does what it's supposed to
==Module testing:== tests across individual units
==Integration testing:== ensures that interfaces between units have consistent assumptions and communicate correctly
==Acceptance/system testing:== tests to see if the integrated program meets its specifications

## Testing practices
Tests should be "FIRST:"
- **Fast:** Should be easy and fast to run the tests
- **Independent:** No test relies on other tests so that you can run only a subset of tests that cover recent changes
- **Repeatable:** Should not rely on external factors like the date or magic constants that will break the test if their values change 
- **Self-checking:** Tests should not need human checking to know if they passed
- **Timely:** Should be updated at the same time as the code they are for

==Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):== building development around user stories, non-technical user cases etc.
- You can divide and conquer and write different tests at different points in development

==Regression testing:== automatically rerunning old tests so that changes don't break what used to work
==Continuous integration testing:== continuous regression testing vs. later phases

## Structure of a Test Case
==System under test (SUT):== The object being tested. (Single method, group of methods, etc). Defined from the POV of the test
==Test case:== Check that some behavior does or does not happen for some SUT
==Test suite:== A collection of tests
==Left method:== A method that does not call any other methods
==Pure function:== Has no side effects, return val is always the same for the same arguments. The easiest type of function to test

Steps that must be followed to set up a test:
1. **Arrange** create any necessary preconditions for the test case (setting values of variables that affect the behavior or the SUT, etc.)
2. **Act** exercise the SUT
3. **Assert** verify that the result or behavior matches what was expected

- Choose assertions that each cover one code paths

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
: write tests first, for the code you want to have
üìù There's no actual evidence that writing tests before is better
==Red-Green-Refactor:== The basic TDD workflow:
1. Write a test for one aspect of the behavior you want your code to have
2. **Red:** Run the test to verify it fails
3. **Green:** Write the most simple code that causes this test to pass without breaking existing tests
4. **Refactor:** Look for opportunities to refactor your code or your tests
