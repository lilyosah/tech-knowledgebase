%%
: concentrates on the behavior of the app in conversation with the stakeholders before and during development.

**Pros:**
- Common language
- Tests before code  [[Testing#Test-Driven Development TDD]]

**Cons:**
- User stories may be too specific
- May be too much focus on features and not enough on app design

==Story points:== numbers indicating how long a story is expected to take. If it exceeds a certain agreed upon number it should be broken down into sub-stories
==Spikes:== a short investigation into a technique or problem that the team wants explored before sitting down to do serious coding 

## User Stories
: 1-3 sentences written in non-tech language written jointly by customers and devs describing a use case/feature 

==Connextra format:==
- As a \[type of stakeholder]
- So that \[achieve some goal]
- I want to \[do some task]

==SMART stories:== 
- specific
- measurable (characterized with an acceptance test)
- achievable (w/in one iteration)
	- If you can't deliver it in one iteration, break it into smaller sub-tasks w/ fewer story points
- relevant ("5 whys")
- time-boxed (know when to give up)

## UI Design
- ALL stakeholders should be involved in the UI
- Pen and paper designs first, "lo-fi" UI
