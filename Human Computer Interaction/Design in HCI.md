==Stakeholders:== Anyone who is impacted by the endeavor you're engaged with
- How do you create a solution within a space that considers as many stakeholders as possible?

## Wicked problems
Social or cultural problem that is difficult or impossible to solve, may not be able to please all stakeholders, conflict between other stakeholders, interconnected with different problems 

May meet some of these criteria:

1. No definitive formation
2. Impossible to measure or claim success
3. No idealized end-state
4. No template to follow 
5. Generally more than one explanation
6. Every wicked problem is a symptom of another wicked problem
7. No definitive test
8. All unique
9. Designers must be fully responsible for their actions

Non-example:
- Hard math problems

**Ex: ✏**  
- Global pandemic 
- Climate change
- Voter inequality 
- Gerrymandering 
- Tensions with Russia 

### Abductive Reasoning
: Trying to find the best possible answer given the circumstances
- Not concerned with right or correct answer
- Does not result in certainty 
- Result in progress

### Design frameworks
: Ways of navigating the complex task of design
- Where are we now
- What should we do next

> "Process is the net that allows you to leap" - Hartson & Pyla

#### Human-Centered Design
Puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, and then designing to accommodate those needs, capabilities, ways of behaving

Ensure that the designs match the needs of the people for whom they are intended
