## Early HCI History
Vennevar Bush:
- Founder of NSF, Raytheon
- Top science advisor to FDR
- Managed Manhattan Project
- Author of "As We May Think", July 1945
	- Introduced the Memex, an idea for a machine:
		- Prototype of a device to store books, records, personal communications, retrieve info, create "trails" of info between related ideas
	- Anticipated the dev of the internet by 50 years


Lillian Gilbreth (1878-1972):
- Pioneer in accessibility research, got TWO Ph.Ds
- Founder of modern Human Factors
	- Brought human psychology into scientific management and technology
	- "If those who supply the soap, the waterm the sinks, the dishes, etc. actually washed some dishes.... \[things would be much better]"
	- YOU ARE NOT THE USER


J.C.R. Licklider
- Man-Computer Symbiosis (1960)
	- Imagines a partnership between humans and machines that extends the capabilities of the human mind and extends the capabilities of the machine

## HCI In the 60s
- Computers were only available to universities and large corporations, too expensive and inaccessible for everyday use
- Sketchpad (1930)
	- Represents shift from computers as a number-crunching thing to partners in the design and problem solving process
- First mouse (1965)
	- Increased accessibility to technology, suddenly navigating a computer system was something anyone could do
- Englebert's Mother of All Demos (1968)
	- "... human abilities to deal collectively with complex/urgent problems are not increasing as fast as these problems."
	- "... develop new techniques, procedures, and systems that will better adapt peoples basic capabilities..."

Altair 8800 (1975)
- Could build a computer for under $400

Xerox star (1981)
- Simulated desktop
- WYSISYG editor
- Modeless interactions
- First design driven by usability studies
- Commercial failure ($15k)

Apple Macintosh (1984)
- Took "old" ideas from start but did them really well 
- $2.5k
- Encouraged 3rd party software


## Recap
- History of HCI is driven by reimaging our relationship with tech
- Making computers accessible to everyday people is making them usable and making users aware of their capabilities
- The complex problems of our world require partnerships mediated, supported, enhanced by tech
