## Indirect and Direct Manipulation
==Indirect manipulation:==
- command line
- punch cards

==Direct manipulation:==
- lightpen
- mouse

Trajectory: From indirect manipulation to direct. From **artificial** and unintuitive to **natural** and intuitive 
- One downside to this is accessibility concerns. Ex: sensors, if people can't move the way a able-bodied person can the sensors may not work
- Can be differences across cultures in natural gestures
- Can be less efficient Ex: Wiimote instead of controller for fighting games

==Skeuomorphism:== Practice of making digital items resemble their real-world counterparts, visually and functionally
- Skeuomorphs: Things that are made to look like older versions of them

- Morphism tends to shift in popularity

### Blurring lines between physical and digital spaces
