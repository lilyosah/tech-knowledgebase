## Part 1
1.  Affordance
	Pushing water fountain button affords water coming out.

	Because I have the capability of pushing the water button and when I do water comes out.

1.  Signifier
	Fire alarm saying push and pull down. 

	It indicates exactly how to use the fire alarm and the affordance would be it setting off the alarms. 
    
3.  Mapping
	Volume up button on TV. 

	When you press up on the volume button the volume increases, and when you press down the volume decreases. The volume maps to the direction you indicate. 
    
4.  Feedback
	Light on extension cord.

	When the strip is turned on a light appears, giving feedback that electricity is flowing. 
    
5.  Constraint
	Wall power outlet socket. 

	You can only plug one type of cord in, where you plug it in in the room is constrained, meaning you need to be close to it, and the direction you plug it is also often constrained. You may need to turn the cord upside down to plug it in.


## Part 3

I want to get power to the things plugged into the power strip. The alternatives are plugging it in somewhere else. I can plug the cord in to the strip but if I have no power then nothing changes. I see a power button that has a 0 and 1 on either side and can flip one of those two ways. This indicates that maybe I should press the button to face the 1. It's sort of intuitive and is language independent. If I press the button then it lights up and a light on top turns on. It also makes a nice clicking noise. I assume if the light is on then there is power. I think this is good because now I have power. 

It helps to bridge the gulfs of execution and evaluation because there is some indication of which way you should push the button. When you do it provides okay feedback by making a clicking sound to show the button has been flipped and it lights up to show that power is flowing.
