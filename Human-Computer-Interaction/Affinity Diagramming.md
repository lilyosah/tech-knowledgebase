- All notes are consolidated into an affinity diagram
- Organize data points under labels (stickies on the wall)
- Not just sorting - discovering patterns that emerge from the data itself 


About ==inductive reasoning:== pattern matching
- UX's Ouija board, not deductive! Don't make sense of things

## Rules

Force you to think about data in different ways

- Groups must have more than 1 and no more than 7 notes
- All notes must fit under some heading 
	- Can put notes in a little recycling area

## Colors and levels

Write clear and concise descriptions
Labels are derived from the data

> "Labels become the meaning we design from"

### Insight summaries

- Should read like newspaper headlines
- Look for intents, surprises
- Keep trying to go deeper for a deeper understanding -> Better insights
- Depth of understanding is the difference between an interesting model and a boring one
- Written as though the user is talking to the team

**Ex: ‚úè** Good vs. Bad insight summary
- **Good:** "Having choices over food potions keeps me from getting bored"
- **Bad:** "Users like choice"

### Yellows

Data points themselves

### Blues

First person **summary insight** from first person POV summary
- Describe notes in the group well
- Every note should be described by a blue note
- If a note does not fit a label, reorganize into another group or under another label
- It's okay to revise as you go

### Pinks

First person **summary insight** of blue post-its

### Green

Summaries of pink post its

c2 = 2002
c3 = 2000

Because then changes could be made to the balance without other possible side-effects of those changes being processed. For example, outside code may directly set a cards balance to be higher than the credit limit, something that code that changes the balance within the CreditCard class should prevent.

Static: ExtendOnlyExpired
This must be static because it can't be called on any one particular CreditCard instance in the way that you call non-static methods, it needs to work with several credit cards. 

Non-static: ExtendExpireDate
I think this *could* be made static but it makes more sense to implement it as a non-static method because you are only extending the expiration date of one CreditCard instance, the one that you are calling it on.

I think there's a possibility that the must keyword here may confuse people but it's probably fine.
