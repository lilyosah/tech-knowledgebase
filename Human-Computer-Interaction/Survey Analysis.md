## Quantitative Data

### Common Descriptive Stats:
- Count
- Percentage
- Mean
- Mode
- Median
- Range
- Standard Dev.
- Variance.
- Ranking

### Inferential Stats
Tests to determine statistical significance
Ex: Chi square, t-test, ANOCA

#### Regression
Tests cause-and-effect relationships

#### Comparison tests
Look for differences among group means

## Qualitative Data
Short answer, text entry, other
- Can be detail rich
- May be in narrative format
- Code responses by theme 
- Basically tag things

Can make pivot tables on excel

## Heuristic evaluation

A approach to a problem that employs a practical method that is not guaranteed to be optimal, perfect, or rational, but can provide a short-term approximation.
Best known and most popular UX evaluation method.

- When an expert UX inspector compares aspects of the design against a set of heuristics (general high-level US design guidelines)
- Expert evaluation

**Advantages:**
- Inexpensive
- Intuitive
- Can be effective

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires expertise
- Imprecise, room for disagreement
- Does not account for context

### 1. Visibility of System Status

System should keep users informed about what's going on through appropriate feedback within a reasonable time

### 2. Matching between the System and the Real World

System should speak the users' language with familiar words, phrases, and concepts rather than system oriented terms.
If you do this well, you demonstrate **empathy** for your users.

- Never assume that your own interpretations and understanding of words or objects natch those of our users

### 3. User Control and Freedom

Always have an emergency exit to leave the unwanted state without having to go through extended dialog
- Undo and cancel
- Especially important on mobile

### 4. Consistency and Standards

Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing
- UI should be predictable and learnable

==Internal consistency:== consistency within a companies products
==External consistency:== maintaining established conventions for UI in your industry or in general. Ex: long press and hold

### 5. Error Prevention

Better than good error messages is preventing errors from occurring in the first place

### 6. Recognition rather than recall

Minimize the memory load by making options visible. The user should not have to remember information
Influenced by:
- Practice
- Recency
- Context

### 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

==Accelerator:== Any option that speeds up the process

Should be able to function efficiently for experts while still being easily learnable for newbies

### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information

==Signal to noise ratio:== ratio of relevant to irrelevant

Focus on essentials, don't decorate
Also order by priority

### 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors	

### 10. Help and Documentation
