# Conceptual Design

: User-centered design process built upon in-depth field research to drive innovative design

- Usability testing doesn't really help to create innovative products 
- Must design for life: consider how a product fits into all of the contexts of everyday life

## Phases
1. Immerse yourself in the life of individual users through field visits
2. Use big picture to drive ideation, inventing new product concepts form user data
3. Product concepts are used to create user interfaces and behavior which are validated and iterated with users

## Core concepts
- **Design for life**, not just for an individual task or activity
- **Immersion in the users' world** to tune intuition and focus design thinking
- **Design in teams** because in the real world its a team of people that need to come together to create something

### Immersion
Building without checking with users relies on an intuition of the users, and not really understanding the activities of the customers
- To design for the customers, a team must be steeped in the life context of the users they are supporting
- Contextual design includes a well-defined set of immersion activities 

#### The Contextual Inquiry field interview
When the designed sits in the user's environment and finds out firsthand what the user's world is like

"Explicit, articulated user data gathered through well-defined public process ensures the data is trustworthy, avoiding arguments about what is best for the users"

We do not ask what the users **want** (they can't tell you),  understand the **lives** of the users so that you can invent the product that will transform their lives.
