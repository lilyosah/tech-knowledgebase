: User-centered design process built upon in-depth field research to drive innovative design - well-structured opportunities for immersion into the lives of users, allow us to continuously tun our intuitions
- Needfinding, modeling, ideation, prototyping

Many failures are due to a mismatch between what the designers think the users want and what they actually want 

- Usability testing doesn't really help to create innovative products 
- Must design for life: consider how a product fits into all of the contexts of everyday life

Instead of designing for the I, design from **rich user data**
Surveys generally don't provide rich data
- Users generally take surveys outside of the context they are asked about

## Phases
Do **NOT** start with ideation. üö© Red flags: "I like this feature"
Better: "In our data, some users mentioned that they like..."

1. Immerse yourself in the life of individual users through field visits
2. Use big picture to drive ideation, inventing new product concepts form user data
3. Product concepts are used to create user interfaces and behavior which are validated and iterated with users

## Core concepts
- **Design for life**, not just for an individual task or activity
- **Immersion in the users' world** to tune intuition and focus design thinking
- **Design in teams** because in the real world its a team of people that need to come together to create something

### Immersion
Building without checking with users relies on an intuition of the users, and not really understanding the activities of the customers
- To design for the customers, a team must be steeped in the life context of the users they are supporting
- Contextual design includes a well-defined set of immersion activities 

#### Contextual Inquiry
Going to where users do the thing you're interested in, watching them while asking questions
Being in the context allows us to:
- Unravel the vital parts from the relevant parts
- Observe the emotional energy
- Keeps the user from generalizing (In general I eat healthy)
	- If they start speaking in abstractions, we want to bring them back to real-world specific instances 

"Explicit, articulated user data gathered through well-defined public process ensures the data is trustworthy, avoiding arguments about what is best for the users"

We do not ask what the users **want** (they can't tell you),  understand the **lives** of the users so that you can invent the product that will transform their lives.
- They don't always know what they want or need
- **Ex: ‚úè** No one knew they needed a walkman until walkmans existed
- Look for unmet desires, not user needs

==Tacit data:== behaviors that have become so habitual that users don't realize they are doing them or can't explain why they are doing them
- If you're not there with the user in the context they're doing them in you're miss tacit data

##### In Practice 
- One-on-one two hour interview
- Tell them your interpretations and they will probably correct them if they are wrong
- Look out for 

##### Hierarchy of Competence
Competence
Consciousness

- Unconscious competence (You're so good you kind of don't know what you know. Ex: Professor)
	- Users are here!
- Conscious competence (You understand what you know. Ex: TA)
- Conscious incompetence 
- Unconscious incompetence (You don't know what you don't know)
	- Designers are here!

###### Apprenticeship Model
: You are an apprentice, the user is the master
- Not a list of rules but a way of being
- Requires that you adopt an attitude of inquiry, encourages the user to disclosure and sharing 

Fosters:
- **Humility** (they know more than you)
- **Attention** (you want that information)
- **Inquiry** (you will constantly ask to obtain that information)
- **Detail** (You want to know about every aspect of the practice)
