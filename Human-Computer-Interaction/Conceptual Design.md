: User-centered design process built upon in-depth field research to drive innovative design - well-structured opportunities for immersion into the lives of users, allow us to continuously tun our intuitions
- Needfinding, modeling, ideation, prototyping

Many failures are due to a mismatch between what the designers think the users want and what they actually want 

- Usability testing doesn't really help to create innovative products 
- Must design for life: consider how a product fits into all of the contexts of everyday life

Instead of designing for the I, design from **rich user data**
Surveys generally don't provide rich data
- Users generally take surveys outside of the context they are asked about

## Phases
Do **NOT** start with ideation. ðŸš© Red flags: "I like this feature"
Better: "In our data, some users mentioned that they like..."

1. Immerse yourself in the life of individual users through field visits
2. Use big picture to drive ideation, inventing new product concepts form user data
3. Product concepts are used to create user interfaces and behavior which are validated and iterated with users

## Core concepts
- **Design for life**, not just for an individual task or activity
- **Immersion in the users' world** to tune intuition and focus design thinking
- **Design in teams** because in the real world its a team of people that need to come together to create something

### Immersion
Building without checking with users relies on an intuition of the users, and not really understanding the activities of the customers
- To design for the customers, a team must be steeped in the life context of the users they are supporting
- Contextual design includes a well-defined set of immersion activities
