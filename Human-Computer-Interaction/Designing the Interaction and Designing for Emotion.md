Devices shape the nature of interactions
Different devices have different affordances, constraints, usage conventions

Creating an interaction design
- Identify all devices and their roles in the usage context or "ecology"
	- What role does a smartwatch play vs. a smartphone vs. a laptop
	- Content generation vs. content consumption
- How might the same task sequence be carried out across different devices as the user switches contexts within the ecology


## Pattern Library vs Style Guide vs. UI Library
### Style guides
help ensure a consistent and coherent UI

### Pattern Libraries
serve the same purpose, but are generally more fundamental, detailed, and comprehensive

### UI Library
provide the components

Breaking rules can let you stand out but it comes with a risk, so be careful

## Information Architecture

- Should be pervasive: info should be accessible across all devices at all times

## Designing for Emotional Needs
- Satisfaction, meaningfulness, joy
- Aesthetics

Focuses on emotional impact and value-sensitive aspects of design
