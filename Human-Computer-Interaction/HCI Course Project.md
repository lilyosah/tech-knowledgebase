	- If one thing gets behind it can mess everything else 
	- "Unchangeable"
	- Does time blocking on phone during finals when things are really deadline focused
- Uses two columns, they're flexible, mainly events and tasks
- Bullet journals stress her out
- Has numbers below for events and time-blocking
- Also has blank pages, mostly for time-blocking
- Uses notion, and calendar 
- Doesn't use habit tracking 
	- Wants to be texted, "text back Y if you did it, N if you didn't"
- Wants a newsletter style thin. Email a daily summary of events, tasks, everything combined
