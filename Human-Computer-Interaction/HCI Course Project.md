# HCI Course Project: Designing "Irrational" Technology 
 
 =="Irrational" technology:== How can we change how we engage in activities that are humanistic in nature that serve no logical purpose (but does serve an emotional or cultural one)

Domains of irrationationality: Art, music, religion, play, sport 

Ideas:
Music
Discovering music 
What software they use, if they ask friends, pain points
How do people listen to music, what are the context
- Do you want to be listening to new music in certain situations?
How do people find concerts 

## Contextual Inquiry

- Take data from the world and turn it into models, then validate those models in the world

Interview should start from before they're doing the activity to after 
- Stop when you stop learning new things

‚ùì How are we supposed to follow them around as they discover music



- Interview people listening to music in different contexts, coordinate with the team
	- "What do you do when you listen to music, what are different contexts"
- Figure this out ahead of time

### Questions


## Modeling

- Are we using the models correctly
- Are we gathering/modeling rich and interesting data 
- Only pick two models for each user 

Which two will we use:
