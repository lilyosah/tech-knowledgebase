# HCI Course Project: Designing "Irrational" Technology 
 
 =="Irrational" technology:== How can we change how we engage in activities that are humanistic in nature that serve no logical purpose (but does serve an emotional or cultural one)

Domains of irrationationality: Art, music, religion, play, sport 

Ideas:
Music
Discovering music 
What software they use, if they ask friends, pain points
How do people listen to music, what are the context
- Do you want to be listening to new music in certain situations?
How do people find concerts 

## Contextual Inquiry

- Take data from the world and turn it into models, then validate those models in the world

Interview should start from before they're doing the activity to after 
- Stop when you stop learning new things

‚ùì How are we supposed to follow them around as they discover music


How do peoples activities/environment shape how they engage with music 
- Interview people listening to music in different contexts, coordinate with the team
	- "What do you do when you listen to music, what are different contexts"
- Figure this out ahead of time

### Questions
IF it's dangerous or you can't interview them in that context, get as close to the context as you can . Ex: For shower, go into the bathroom and run water and interview there, don't as them to undress obvs


First, ask about their streaming services and stuff:
- How do you listen to music, open up the service
- Go through Spotify/whatever, what are their playlists for
- What were they most recently listening to and what they were doing while they were listening to it
- If they don't have playlists, ask them why
- Ask them to play music, why did they choose that
- Do they use shuffle, ex.

Part of the interview about questions in the context:
- Why do you listen to this music
- How focused are you on the music/activity, etc.
- How are you feeling right now, keep asking this. Need to find out about their internal state
- Are they using earbuds, listening out loud, etc.
