: Going to where users do the thing you're interested in, watching them while asking questions

Being in the context allows us to:
- Unravel the vital parts from the relevant parts
- Observe the emotional energy
- Keeps the user from generalizing (In general I eat healthy)
	- If they start speaking in abstractions, we want to bring them back to real-world specific instances 

"Explicit, articulated user data gathered through well-defined public process ensures the data is trustworthy, avoiding arguments about what is best for the users"

We do not ask what the users **want** (they can't tell you),  understand the **lives** of the users so that you can invent the product that will transform their lives.
- They don't always know what they want or need
- **Ex: ‚úè** No one knew they needed a walkman until walkmans existed
- Look for unmet desires, not user needs

==Tacit data:== behaviors that have become so habitual that users don't realize they are doing them or can't explain why they are doing them
- If you're not there with the user in the context they're doing them in you're miss tacit data

## Types of Interviews

==Structured:== Interview is driven by a series of pre-written questions, consistent data but less room for an unanticipated answer
- Useful if you need certain data 
==Semi-structured:== Come with many questions but are willing to deviate 
- As you learn, more structure helps
==Unstructured:== Few or no pre-written questions
- When you don't know anything 

## In Practice 

### Planning
- Define the problem you would like to solve
	- Think of an area of life, assume that that task isn't perfect 
- What are the tasks or activities associated with that problem that you can ask your users to engage with as you observe them?
- Who are you going to talk to?
- How will you record information?
	- Handwritten notes are probably best, if you're recording then you may not take good enough notes


### During the interview
1. Introduce yourself and your role
2. Explain your purpose
3. Get consent/permission to record
	1. Generally when conducting research, you want to consider risks
	2. All your data for this should be anonymous

#### Do ask:
- open-ended questions:
Behavioral questions
- Can you describe an occasion when... and what you did
Feeling Questions
- Maybe ask these at the end 
- Make sure you're asking about things they're currently doing, not hypotheticals.

- Wait for them to respond
- Ask "why" until you get an interesting answer or the subject gets frustrated 
- Ask for more details on anything that sounds interesting
- Repeat, rephrase, summarize to make sure you understand
- Clarify terms
- Ask for step-by-step actions 
- If there's silence, ask them what they're doing. Make them verbalize it

#### Don't ask:
- Hypothetical
- Features
- What others might like
- How to design an interface
- Double-barrel questions

#### Context
- One-on-one two hour interview

#### Partnership
- Work with them as partnerships in inquiry
- Let them lead
- Be nosy about what they're doing
- Ask about the details of the task and the intent behind the users actions

#### Interpretation
- Create a shared understanding
- Draw out the implications
- Tell them your interpretations and they will probably correct them if they are wrong
- Look out for generalizations and ask for them to give you examples within the past couple of days 
- Pay attention to body language

#### Focus
- Stick to your focus and share your focus with them - ignore details that are not relevant but pursue anything that surprises you 

- You should end up with 10-20 pages of handwritten notes


### Ending the interview
Leave background for last
- Least important
Use a questionnaire
Ask for suggestions, last thoughts, things we did not discuss
**Thank them** and provide contact details if they have any questions

## Hierarchy of Competence
Competence
Consciousness

- Unconscious competence (You're so good you kind of don't know what you know. Ex: Professor)
	- Users are here!
- Conscious competence (You understand what you know. Ex: TA)
- Conscious incompetence 
- Unconscious incompetence (You don't know what you don't know)
	- Designers are here!

### Apprenticeship Model
: You are an apprentice, the user is the master
- Not a list of rules but a way of being
- Requires that you adopt an attitude of inquiry, encourages the user to disclosure and sharing 

Fosters:
- **Humility** (they know more than you)
- **Attention** (you want that information)
- **Inquiry** (you will constantly ask to obtain that information)
- **Detail** (You want to know about every aspect of the practice)
