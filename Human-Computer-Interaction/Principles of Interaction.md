HCI is an artifact, an ecology, communication and collaboration?

If experience is crucial, how do we ensure the experience is enjoyable and not frustrating

Need the language to talk about sources of friction

## Discoverability

How easily can you figure out:
1. What something does
2. How it works
3. What operations are possible

Good discoverability is the result of good applications of principles of interaction


## Affordances
: What actions are possible given the capabilities of an agent 
The relationship between the properties of and object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used
- Not a property, a relationship 
- Exist even if they're not visible 

**Ex: ‚úè** A child trying to ride an adult bike is not an affordance 

### Anti-affordance 
: Prevent the interaction
to be useful affordances must be discoverable

## Signifiers 

:Signal the presence of an affordance of anti-affordance
**Ex: ‚úè** A sign indicating which way to turn something to lock it 

## Constraints
Used to limit ... something.

Ex: Validations to make sure a password is vlaid


## Mapping

: The relationship between two sets of things
Does the digital interaction "map" to an analogous physical interaction
- Natural mappings (space something) are most intuitive

**Ex: ‚úè** Steering wheel in a car
**Ex: ‚úè** Boat tiller may not be

## Feedback

: Communication of the result of an action

Every action must have feedback
Must be appropriate, can have too much

Sometimes delaying feedback can be valuable 

## Conceptual Models

: A simplified explanation of how something works
A good conceptual model allows us to predict the effects of our actions 

**Ex: ‚úè** Files and folders no a desktop create a conceptual model
