==Speed dating:== allows design teams to explore possible futures with target users
- Reduces the risk of making things people wont like
- Leverage experiences that people have already had
	- Allow users to infer how they might react to new products 


- Validating concepts reduces risk
- No way to predict future user needs and desires

==Sketching:== brainstorming and considering many possible solutions to a potential problem

- Users are reluctant to criticize a single idea

## How To

- Replace partners with concepts (storyboards)
- Create opportunities for multiple, low-cow engagements
- Look for experiences, not just: "I like this one more"
	- Ask why. Would they still like it more if X, if Y
- Don't be afraid to cross boundaries (use magic, violate social norms to see id they're important)

## Instructions

- Go out and find someone who might be a potential user
- Ask them to read through the storyboard out loud and verbalize their thoughts and reactions while they're reading it
	- "Please keep talking"
- Ask them questions about specific frames
	- Think of these beforehand
	- Annie:
		- Ask about first, how often do they make playlists for study sessions
		- How often tdo you make them, how many do they have
		- Based on location
		- Based on familiarity 
	- Michael: 
		- Getting the recommendations
		- How often do you listen to specific music in specific weather
- Follow-up on reactions with hypotheticals (What if it was this way instead)
	- "Why wouldn't you use it more?"
- Take detailed notes
- Move on to the next storyboard
- After, ask them to compare and contrast each storyboard
