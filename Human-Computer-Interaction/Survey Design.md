	- Observation

	- Pupil dilation, etc.


## Interviews Vs. Survey

### Interviews
- Explore a domain, rapport-building.

#### Cons: 
Expensive, requires interpretation, coding
Difficult to make comparisons

### Surveys
- Defined sample from larger population
- Low-cost
- Ask many questions
- Standardized data
- Quantitative results

Cons:
- Nood good for starting research 
- Determining questions to ask
- Clarifying responses is harder
- Following up on unexpected/interesting comments

## Process
### 1: Define the goal
What are we trying to measure? 
If the goal isn't unique, steal from other surveys, creating a reliable and valid measurement of a construct is difficult and error-prone (Ex: social class, intelligence)

Designing your own if you must:
- Identify the main concepts you want to measure 
- Develop a large number of candidate questions
- Ensure there is only one interpretation
- Remove and explain jargon
- Word questions to avoid social desirability bias 

Pretest: 
- Ask ppl to complete the survey while thinking out loud 

### 2: Determining the sample

Random sampling: Random
Convience sampling: From whoever's around
Snowball sampling: Recruit people from prior takers

Do they have access to the internet if it's online?

### 3 Designing a survey 

Start with an introduction that includes instructions and talks about privacy

#### First questions 
Your first questions should be clearly relevant and easy to answer
**Ex: ‚úè**  
Have you used a mobile phone for any purpose since you woke up today?

Save sensitive data (like demographics) for the end
- Often irrelevant to your core questions, but help to ensure your sample is diverse along these demographic lines

#### Good question writing
- Good questions are understood by all respondents?
	- Understand terms: Be stupid
	- Understand intent:
		- **Ex: ‚úè** 
			Bad: How many people live in your household?
			Better: How many people, including yourself, live in your household?
- With agree/disagree questions, ask about the extremes

#### Bad question writing 
- Heterogeneity in the object: Are respondents talking about the same object/experience. Better to ask about a concrete instance
- Double barrel questions: Only ask one thing at once
- Hypotheticals or limited experience: Are the respondents drawing from real experience 
	- Rely on real experience instead
- Second-hand accounts
- Beware of asking about causality. What is the main reason you purchased X

#### Response bias
It's unavoidable. Bad memory, etc. But you can try to limit it.

Think about intents, maybe we're interested in the relative importance of Facebook use

#### Measuring attitudes
Attitude: A predisposition to behave in a favorable or unfavorable manner

Cognitive: Non-evaluative beliefs about the thing. Ex: Belief about the number of apps in the app store
Affective:  Feelings or evaluations about the thing. Ex: Feelings or evaluations about the object
Behavioral: Behaviors they do about the thing!


#### Types of Response Tasks
- Likert: As for a response on a continuum (Agree to disagere)
- Rank order objects
- How many categories should you have: Like agree, strongle agree... Etc.
- Ask as many categories as possible if people can still make good distinctions
	- Researchers say 5-7
