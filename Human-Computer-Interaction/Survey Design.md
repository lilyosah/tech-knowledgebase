## Interviews Vs. Survey

### Interviews
- Explore a domain, rapport-building.

#### Cons: 
Expensive, requires interpretation, coding
Difficult to make comparisons

### Surveys
- Defined sample from larger population
- Low-cost
- Ask many questions
- Standardized data
- Quantitative results

Cons:
- Nood good for starting research 
- Determining questions to ask
- Clarifying responses is harder
- Following up on unexpected/interesting comments

## Process
### 1: Define the goal
What are we trying to measure? 
If the goal isn't unique, steal from other surveys, creating a reliable and valid measurement of a construct is difficult and error-prone (Ex: social class, intelligence)

Designing your own if you must:
- Identify the main concepts you want to measure 
- Develop a large number of candidate questions
- Ensure there is only one interpretation
- Remove and explain jargon
- Word questions to avoid social desirability bias 

Pretest: 
- Ask ppl to complete the survey while thinking out loud 

### 3: Determining the sample
