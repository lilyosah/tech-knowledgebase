## Interpretation

: Developing a shared understanding of data
- Interpretation sessions let each team member experience all interviews
- Looks like reciting the interview alongside modeling of the data
- "Wrestling with the data and what it means"
- Will repeat for each interview

	- Capture key observations, issues, and quotes

## Models

"All models are wrong but some are useful"

: Help to bridge the gap between data and design. Help to focus on what is important for design
- Give us a visual representation that allow us to see the big picture
- Many types

Making many models from your data and then consolidatin those models into few models

### Types

#### Sequence-Flow Models

Capture expertise: Strategy, intent, triggers and what matters

Sequence: Work tasks are often an ordered sequence of actions, unfolding over time
Flow: How work is broken up across people, how do they coordinate
- Time and place: Where doe this occur and over what time scale?
- Individuals and groups: bubble with group names, annotates with responsibilities
- Intents: And objective for the individual/group
- Flow: Communication between individuals, groups, artifacts
